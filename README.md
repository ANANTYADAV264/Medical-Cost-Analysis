# Medical-Cost-Analysis
This project delves into the realm of medical cost analysis, employing linear regression as the cornerstone of predictive modeling. By leveraging a diverse dataset encompassing medical variables and corresponding costs, we embarked on a meticulous journey of data exploration, feature engineering, and model development.

Through rigorous preprocessing steps including data cleaning, feature scaling, and addressing potential multicollinearity, we primed the dataset for regression analysis. The linear regression algorithm was then harnessed to discern underlying trends and relationships between medical attributes and incurred costs.

The resultant model yielded promising outcomes, offering valuable insights into the factors influencing medical expenses. With an accuracy of 98% and precise estimations of cost variables, our analysis equips stakeholders with actionable intelligence for cost containment, resource allocation, and informed decision-making within healthcare systems
